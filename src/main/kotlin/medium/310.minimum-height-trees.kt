 *
 * For an undirected graph with tree characteristics, we can choose any node as
 * the root. The result graph is then a rooted tree. Among all possible rooted
 * trees, those with minimum height are called minimum height trees (MHTs).
 * Given such a graph, write a function to find all the MHTs and return a list
 * of their root labels.
 * 
 * Format
 * The graph contains n nodes which are labeled from 0 to n - 1. You will be
 * given the number n and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of
 * labels).
 * 
 * You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges
 * are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear
 * together in edges.
 * 
 * Example 1 :
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 4, edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]
 * 
 * ⁠       0
 * ⁠       |
 * ⁠       1
 * ⁠      / \
 * ⁠     2   3 
 * 
 * Output: [1]
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2 :
 * 
 * 
 * Input: n = 6, edges = [[0, 3], [1, 3], [2, 3], [4, 3], [5, 4]]
 * 
 * ⁠    0  1  2
 * ⁠     \ | /
 * ⁠       3
 * ⁠       |
 * ⁠       4
 * ⁠       |
 * ⁠       5 
 * 
 * Output: [3, 4]
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * According to the definition of tree on Wikipedia: “a tree is an undirected
 * graph in which any two vertices are connected by exactly one path. In other
 * words, any connected graph without simple cycles is a tree.”
 * The height of a rooted tree is the number of edges on the longest downward
 * path between the root and a leaf.
