 *
 * In universe Earth C-137, Rick discovered a special form of magnetic force
 * between two balls if they are put in his new invented basket. Rick has n
 * empty baskets, the i^th basket is at position[i], Morty has m balls and
 * needs to distribute the balls into the baskets such that the minimum
 * magnetic force between any two balls is maximum.
 * 
 * Rick stated that magnetic force between two different balls at positions x
 * and y is |x - y|.
 * 
 * Given the integer array position and the integer m. Return the required
 * force.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: position = [1,2,3,4,7], m = 3
 * Output: 3
 * Explanation: Distributing the 3 balls into baskets 1, 4 and 7 will make the
 * magnetic force between ball pairs [3, 3, 6]. The minimum magnetic force is
 * 3. We cannot achieve a larger minimum magnetic force than 3.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: position = [5,4,3,2,1,1000000000], m = 2
 * Output: 999999999
 * Explanation: We can use baskets 1 and 1000000000.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * n == position.length
 * 2 <= n <= 10^5
 * 1 <= position[i] <= 10^9
 * All integers in position are distinct.
 * 2 <= m <= position.length
 *
