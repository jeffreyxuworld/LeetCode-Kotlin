 *
 * A peak element is an element that is greater than its neighbors.
 * 
 * Given an input array nums, where nums[i] ≠ nums[i+1], find a peak element
 * and return its index.
 * 
 * The array may contain multiple peaks, in that case return the index to any
 * one of the peaks is fine.
 * 
 * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index
 * number 2.
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
 * Output: 1 or 5 
 * Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak
 * element is 2, 
 * or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
 * 
 * 
 * Follow up: Your solution should be in logarithmic complexity.
