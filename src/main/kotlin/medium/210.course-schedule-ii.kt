 * Testcase Example:  '2\n[[1,0]]'
 *
 * There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.
 * 
 * Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have
 * to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]
 * 
 * Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return
 * the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.
 * 
 * There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them.
 * If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
 * Output: [0,1]
 * Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you
 * should have finished   
 * course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
 * Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
 * Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you
 * should have finished both     
 * ⁠            courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you
 * finished course 0. 
 * So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is
 * [0,2,1,3] .
 * 
 * Note:
 * 
 * 
 * The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not
 * adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
 * You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input
 * prerequisites.
