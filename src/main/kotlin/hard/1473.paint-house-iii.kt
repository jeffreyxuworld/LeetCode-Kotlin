 *
 * There is a row of m houses in a small city, each house must be painted with
 * one of the n colors (labeled from 1 to n), some houses that has been painted
 * last summer should not be painted again.
 * 
 * A neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with
 * the same color. (For example: houses = [1,2,2,3,3,2,1,1] contains 5
 * neighborhoods  [{1}, {2,2}, {3,3}, {2}, {1,1}]).
 * 
 * Given an array houses, an m * n matrix cost and an integer target
 * where:
 * 
 * 
 * houses[i]: is the color of the house i, 0 if the house is not painted
 * yet.
 * cost[i][j]: is the cost of paint the house i with the color j+1.
 * 
 * 
 * Return the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in such a way
 * that there are exactly target neighborhoods, if not possible return -1.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: houses = [0,0,0,0,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[10,1],[1,10],[5,1]], m =
 * 5, n = 2, target = 3
 * Output: 9
 * Explanation: Paint houses of this way [1,2,2,1,1]
 * This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, [{1}, {2,2}, {1,1}].
 * Cost of paint all houses (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5) = 9.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: houses = [0,2,1,2,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[10,1],[1,10],[5,1]], m =
 * 5, n = 2, target = 3
 * Output: 11
 * Explanation: Some houses are already painted, Paint the houses of this way
 * [2,2,1,2,2]
 * This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, [{2,2}, {1}, {2,2}]. 
 * Cost of paint the first and last house (10 + 1) = 11.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 3:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: houses = [0,0,0,0,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[1,10],[10,1],[1,10]], m
 * = 5, n = 2, target = 5
 * Output: 5
 * 
 * 
 * Example 4:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: houses = [3,1,2,3], cost = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], m = 4,
 * n = 3, target = 3
 * Output: -1
 * Explanation: Houses are already painted with a total of 4 neighborhoods
 * [{3},{1},{2},{3}] different of target = 3.
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * m == houses.length == cost.length
 * n == cost[i].length
 * 1 <= m <= 100
 * 1 <= n <= 20
 * 1 <= target <= m
 * 0 <= houses[i] <= n
 * 1 <= cost[i][j] <= 10^4
 *
